DONE_____ FAQ page created enter data in it.

DONE_____ ek tracker bnana hai jis sai ki product ko track kr skai.

DONE_____ still issue is there that if a owner has two gyms then he sees same images for two gyms. sol can be passing the query in the template and then displaying images from there.(solving this by displaying one owner can have only one gym and not letting add multiple gym display.)

DONE_____ Ek jo dikkat aayegi vo yeh ha ki transaction_select_time main apn nai yeh nhi pass kiya hai ki agar multiple gyms hai toh konsa gym ka transaction hoga un mai sai.

DONE_____ terms and condition also containd that the user/owner/trainer will be automatically subscribed to our newsletter once he submits details to the website.

DONE_____ When the owner registers another gym then the images which he uploads for that gym are not diaplyed rather images of the first gym are displayed. (This is because in the owner account function rather then passing image as variable we are hard coding the images.)(this is solved by not allowing any of the owner to register more than one gyms)

DONE_____ In the mail which we are sending with html that is not holding images as the images are not on server so a broken image is sent.(done this by adding cloudinary link to the image)

DONE_____ In th begining if we provide skip for now feature in image then we want the image to be default image. But the default image is not been set as the image which we are obtaining from the users and that is store if we use a default then that cant be accepted as a file from request.(skip wlaa feature hi hta diya hai)

DONE_____ In this section currently changing of the details is not allowed so a message is displayed below the submit button.
  If the user wants to change the details then he has to go to the contact section and ask for a changeby sending a mail so make a section related to this.
  
DONE_____ have only one gym details then also it is showing that another gym details in account page.(done this by removing the add another gym wala link)

DONE_____ change gym details mai jo values pehle aani cahiye thi vo nhi aa rhi hai(ho rha hai ab sb shi)

DONE_____ finally trying to integrate the transaction part with paytm.(integrated with the supplementation page)

DONE_____ editting upar jane wala button in all pages.

DONE_____ See if we could make something like the chat application for the user to communicate wiht the trainer.(not needed because if we have rpovided a chat portal for them to communicate then there may be a chance that the trainer gets a lot of message and these could result in ignoring message from client.)

DONE_____ check the links which will be redirecting from one page to another mainly the gymaale heading and the top tabs.(checked many of them are just working fine)

Done_____ limiting the gym owner to not have account in trainer

MUCH MORE FEATURES:-
** in user table also make a column of memberships in which user can apply for memberships in which they can access certain different features of the website which are not available to the masses.

Thingd to be worked on:
* We can integrate auth from twitter facebook,google and github to apply the login from these all sites in our gymaale.(idea dropped currently due to data incosistency issue)
* Also we can used a prebuilt login i.e. from harshkhatri.auth0.com to get it and combine it in our gymaale.(idea dropped currently due to data inconsistency issue)


Things i am not doing:-
* if possible then jo products ko display krwane mai css error aa rhi hai us ko dekhna hai(vo scroll nhi ho rha hai aur 4 products hote hi product neeche aa jata hai 4 sai jyada hote hi vo error deh deta hai)
* OTP system currently charges money
* Apply different forms of sorting( Sorting can be done via these ways:-newest first(sort by id desc),oldest first(sort by id asc), age(sort by age asc or desc),training mode(online,offile or both),diet_suport(yes/no),training_support(yes/no)---------Firstly do by id new and old only. ).
* For the sorting function take an image which on click will display the radiobuttons and on that submit the things will be sorted.
* Change username ka karna hai (tried it and it worked also but rather than updating the username in the pre existing row of the data i created a row with new username and rest of the data to be same which cause the change in the primary id of the account and thus disturbing all the features of the webapp.)
In change user name i also tried to update the username by direct updating and then commiting the final result but that also didnt worked(on logging in the the page kept on refreshing again and again.
* make a feedback floating icon which opens up on clicking and with the help of that user can provide thir feedback. REFERENCE:-https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web_development/9781783983360/5/ch05lvl1sec36/accessing-the-current-user
* Terms and condtions page added. Just add the correct conditions in it seeing the terms of different pages.
* Also if possible to add the notification bell icon which will contain the notifications i.e. the things which we are pushing from our database then it would be good.(This could be done using firebase so see it once.)
* adding a dark theme to the website
* Making the money transaction way between the gyms and users or trainers and users where the user can pay to any of  the one and the money will be deducted from the users account and that will be added to the the account whom he has paid the money.Users can add money with different methods ranging frm card,wallets,net banking etc.or thy could directly pay to the person from their accounts which they have.See how will the main moto of providing qr to the people who pay to the gym for registeration for one day will be carried out.this could also be achived by providing user with the mail and a secret code and the gym owner has to verify the code which could be done by the email sent to him or the table of the users registered for their gym to them in the account section.Work on the transactons so that the user can perform transactions in his or her account. Currently use this as demo transaction which do not involve use of money and that all transactions will be stored in the transaction table we will make and another page transaction will show us the list of all the transactions user is performing.(done this with the demo payment and i have to it for the real payment with paytm accounts.)



ERRORS:
added login with github but the problem which is arising is that many pages in gymaale have query in it related to user table and it is somewhat difficult to add github_user table queries in its place as it would be difficult to specify which query needs to run. So we have make the data model again seeing the facts that the duplication of username(github wale ka hai toh koi aur nhi lai skta usai ya kisi aur ka hai toh github wala use use nhi kr skta.Mail address ko main use kar skte hai ki log mail address ko hi username ki trh use kare).Rather than multiple tables for data login creds and image a single could be there which would save space and also make queries much more efficient.
